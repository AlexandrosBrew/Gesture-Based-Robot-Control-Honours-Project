The robotic and artificial intelligence industry is rapidly developing, particularly with the introduction of human-robotic interaction. This project is aimed at providing an insight into whether computer vision and gestures can be a promising alternative method of controlling robotic systems; using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to recognise, interpret and apply gestures in real time to robotic systems. By the end of the project a prototype robotic system controlled by gestures from a computer vision program will be designed, implemented, evaluated and written into a final report. This project focuses on feasibility, not producing a fully commercial product, the results will be collected in controlled conditions not in massive user trials.
